# Linux2-GroupProject
The script we used to automate the installation process for WordPress/OpenLDAP

The scripts were written with Bash in mind and as such there is no guarantee that the scripts will function correctly with any other shell.

# Requirements
* Debian/Ubuntu
* Two Virtual Machines/Servers, or just one if you are mainly after WordPress
